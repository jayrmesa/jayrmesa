# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jayrmesa/jayrmesa/main/hello.gif" width="40px" height="40px" />

üòÑ Hi, I'm JayR, a recent graduate in Full-Stack Web Development from Lighthouse Labs. I have learn to create dynamic web applications that are user-friendly and functional. I want to use what I learned and honed my skills to develop applications that improve people's day to day lives.

üî≠ Currently, I am updating my resume and LinkedIn profile

## **Projects**

üí¨ Feel free to ask me about the projects I've worked on recently:

- [Slay The KIng](https://github.com/jayrmesa/slay-the-king): a turn-based combat game where the player faces off against a powerful King.
- [Interview Scheduler](https://github.com/jayrmesa/scheduler): An app that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors.
- [Mapr](https://github.com/laurenashley/mapr): A global map app that enables users to view, create, favorite and delete maps and pins.
